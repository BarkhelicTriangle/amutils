amutils: a mediocre (macOS) coreutils implementation
---
Truthfully, amutils is not supposed to be useful. I mean, the goal is for this to eventually be fully compatible with GNU coreutils, but this is more or less a way for me to learn C and make something as i go.

For info about completeness and compatibility, see STATUS.txt in the root of this repository as well as the STATUS.txt in the root of each subproject.
